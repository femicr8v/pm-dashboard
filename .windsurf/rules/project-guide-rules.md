Rule: When working on this project, always follow these guidelines:

1. Use **shadcn/ui** components as the preferred UI library for all pages, components, and layouts.

   - Before using any specific shadcn/ui component, check if that component is already installed in the project.
   - If the required component is not installed, prompt to install it using the official shadcn/ui command.

2. When searching for information, references, or documentation, always use **context7 MCP** for all web searches and documentation lookups.

3. **Always prefer using Playwright MCP tools** for browser-related actions (e.g., navigation, clicking elements, filling forms, taking screenshots, inspecting elements, testing user-visible behavior).

4. Ensure that code is clean, semantic, and accessible, following best practices for maintainability.
